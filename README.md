# Exercise 1.16 - Multiplication formula

Similar to the previous exercise, create a program that multiplies the values stored in two integer variables.

For instance, if the entered numbers are 2 and 8, the program should print the following:

Example output:

```plaintext
Give the first number:
*2*
Give the second number:
*8*
2 * 8 = 16
```

Likewise, if the entered numbers are 277 and 111, the print should be the following:

```plaintext
Give the first number:
*277*
Give the second number:
*111*
277 * 111 = 30747
```
